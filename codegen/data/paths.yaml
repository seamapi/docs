  description: Systems for managing and monitoring access to physical spaces
  overview: |
    Access control systems centralize access authorization for buildings, which means that you can use a single system to grant users access to one or more entrances. An access control system manages the following elements:

    - Who has access
    - The entrances to which users have access
    - The access schedule for each user and entrance
    - The access mechanism—PIN codes, mobile keys, or plastic cards—for each access grant

    To grant access using the Seam access control system API, use the following basic process:

    1. Create `acs_user`s.
    2. Configure access for these users.
       For some access control systems, configure the allowed entrances and access schedule. For other systems, use `acs_access_group`s. For details, see the [system integration guide](https://docs.seam.co/latest/device-and-system-integration-guides/overview#access-control-systems) for your access control system.
    3. Create `acs_credential`s, which are the digital means of granting access to users, such as PIN codes, mobile keys, and plastic (RFID) cards.
       If you are developing a mobile app to provide access for your users, you can also use [Seam's iOS and Android SDKs](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/mobile-access/mobile-device-sdks) that pair with the Seam API to create and manage mobile keys.

    - [Errors](./#errors)

    - [Events](./#events)
    - [Endpoints](./#endpoints)

    Represents a [thermostat](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats).

    You can use the Seam API to perform the following management and monitoring actions for thermostats:

    - Monitor current thermostat settings and readings.
    - Configure [temperature thresholds](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats/setting-and-monitoring-temperature-thresholds). If the thermostat reports a temperature outside these thresholds, Seam automatically alerts you.
    - Make immediate changes to [thermostat climate settings](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats/configure-current-climate-settings), such as the HVAC mode and fan mode.
    - [Create](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats/creating-and-managing-climate-presets) and [schedule](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats/creating-and-managing-thermostat-schedules) climate presets, including a fallback climate preset.
    - Create daily and weekly [thermostat programs](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats/creating-and-managing-thermostat-programs).

    The Seam API represents a thermostat as a `device` resource that includes both basic device properties and thermostat-specific properties.

    - [Properties](./#properties)
    - [Endpoints](./#endpoints)

    Represents a [noise sensor](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/noise-sensors).

    Noise sensors are devices that measure that sound level in a given area. You can use noise sensors to monitor noise levels remotely and receive notifications when the noise volume is too loud. The Seam API enables you to configure the [noise thresholds](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/noise-sensors/configure-noise-threshold-settings) of a noise sensor and receive events when a disturbance is detected. You can also [simulate triggering a noise threshold](https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/noise_sensors/simulate/trigger_noise_threshold.md).

    The Seam API represents a noise sensor as a `device` resource that includes both basic device properties and noise sensor-specific properties.

    Represents a [lock](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats).

    The Seam API enables you to control connected smart locks from a wide variety of manufacturers, including locks that provide online and offline [access code](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes) programming.

    Depending on the smart lock brand and model, actions that you can perform include remote unlock, remote lock, and programming access codes. You can also view a lock's properties, capabilities, and status. Further, you can monitor for unlock and lock events.
