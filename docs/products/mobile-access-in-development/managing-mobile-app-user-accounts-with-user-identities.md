# Managing Mobile App User Accounts with User Identities

## What is a User Identity?

Seam user identities are a feature for tracking and managing user accounts in your application. This feature assigns unique identifiers to each of your users, enabling you to issue and manage their [mobile credentials](./#managing-mobile-credentials) and access permissions. Each user identity is mapped to a user account in your app.

### User Identities Can Be Connected to Users in Multiple Access Control Systems

User identities can be linked to one [ACS user](../access-systems/#what-is-a-user) in each access control system. Any mobile credentials issued to these ACS users are consolidated under the user identity. Consequently, a user's mobile app account has access to these credentials through the user identity.

## Create a User Identity and Associate it with an ACS User

### 1. Create a User Identity

To [create a user identity](../../api-clients/user-identities/create-a-user-identity.md), you can specify any of the following characteristics:

* Unique user identity key (`user_identity_key`)
* Unique email address (`email_address`)
* Unique phone number (`phone_number`)
* Full name (`full_name`)

Note that if you specify one or more of the `user_identity_key`, `email_address`, or `phone_number`, each of these values must be unique within your [workspace](../../core-concepts/workspaces/).

## Removing a User Identity

To delete a user identity, you must first delete any [ACS credentials](../../api-clients/access-control-systems/credentials/delete-credential.md) and [enrollment automations](../../api-clients/user-identities/enrollment-automations/) associated with the user identity. You must also deactivate any associated phones. Then, delete the user identity.

```python
import asyncio

async def delete_user_identity(user_identity_id):
    # Delete the client sessions.
    client_sessions = await seam.client_sessions.list(
        user_identity_id=user_identity_id
    )
    
    for session in client_sessions:
        await seam.client_sessions.delete(
            session_id=session['client_session_id']
        )
    
    # Delete the ACS users and credentials.
    acs_users = await seam.acs.users.list(
        user_identity_id=user_identity_id
    )
    
    for acs_user in acs_users:
        credentials = await seam.acs.credentials.list(
            acs_user_id=acs_user['acs_user_id']
        )
    
        for credential in credentials:
            await seam.acs.credentials.delete(
                acs_credential_id=credential['acs_credential_id']
            )
        
        await asyncio.gather(*[
            wait_for_acs_credential_deleted(credential) 
            for credential in credentials
        ])
        
        await seam.acs.users.delete(
            acs_user_id=acs_user['acs_user_id']
        )
    
    await asyncio.gather(*[
        wait_for_acs_user_deleted(acs_user) for acs_user in acs_users

    # Delete the enrollment automations.
    enrollment_automations = await seam.user_identities.enrollment_automations.list(
        user_identity_id=user_identity_id

    for automation in enrollment_automations:
        await seam.user_identities.enrollment_automations.delete(

    await asyncio.gather(*[
        wait_for_enrollment_automation_deleted(automation) 
        for automation in enrollment_automations
    ])
    
    # Delete the phones.
    phones = await seam.phones.list(
        owner_user_identity_id=user_identity_id
    )
    
    for phone in phones:
        await seam.phones.deactivate(
            device_id=phone['device_id']
        )

    await asyncio.gather(*[
        wait_for_phone_deactivated(phone) for phone in phones
    ])
    
    # Finally, delete the user identity.
    await seam.user_identities.delete(
        user_identity_id=user_identity_id
    )

# Helper functions for waiting on deletion events
async def wait_for_event(event_type, event_filter):
    while True:
        events = await seam.events.list(event_type=event_type)
        if any(event_filter(event) for event in events):
            break

async def wait_for_acs_user_deleted(acs_user):
    await wait_for_event(
        'acs_user.deleted',
        lambda event: 'acs_user_id' in event and 
                      event.acs_user_id == acs_user.acs_user_id
    )

async def wait_for_enrollment_automation_deleted(enrollment_automation):
    await wait_for_event(
        'enrollment_automation.deleted',
        lambda event: 'enrollment_automation_id' in event and 
                      event.enrollment_automation_id == enrollment_automation.enrollment_automation_id
