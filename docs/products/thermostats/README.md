## What Is a Smart Thermostat?

A smart thermostat is a device designed for home automation that enables you to control your home heating and air conditioning system remotely. An evolution of the traditional thermostat, smart thermostats provide enhanced functions that leverage technology for convenience, efficiency, and energy savings. Smart thermostats often come equipped with features like learning capabilities, energy-saving modes, and integration with other smart home systems.

The Seam API enables you to manage your smart thermostats from a central console so that you can set climate schedules that keep your property comfortable automatically when occupied and switch to energy savings when unoccupied.

Leverage the Seam API for the following smart thermostat-related applications:

* **Adjusting current settings:** Modify the current climate and fan modes based on your immediate needs, whether you are on location or away.
* **Scheduling climate settings for the future:** Plan ahead by setting temperature preferences for future dates and times. For example, if you plan to have a guest at a rental home, you can schedule the house to warm up just before their arrival.
* **Default energy savings:** Program the thermostat to use a default climate setting as a "vacation mode" or "energy savings mode" to minimize energy consumption when your property is unoccupied.

## **Climate Settings**

Using the Seam API, you can configure the following groups of climate settings on a thermostat:

* [**Current climate setting**](configure-current-climate-settings.md)**:** The current heating and cooling settings on a smart thermostat, including the [HVAC mode](hvac-mode.md) and its corresponding [set points](set-points.md).
* [**Fan mode**](configure-current-climate-settings.md)**:** Whether the fan operates all the time (on) or only when needed (auto).&#x20;
* [**Default climate setting**](setting-the-default-climate-setting.md)**:** The set of default HVAC settings on a smart thermostat that applies when a [climate setting schedule](thermostats-climate-setting-schedules.md) ends—such as when the room, unit, or home becomes vacant.
* [**Climate setting schedules**](thermostats-climate-setting-schedules.md)**:** Smart thermostat schedules that control the climate for specific periods of time in users' homes or businesses.
