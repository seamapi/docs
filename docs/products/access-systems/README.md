Use the Seam access control system (ACS) API to grant and manage access to apartment buildings, hotels, commercial offices, warehouses, special-purpose facilities, and much more. Seam integrates with multiple ACS systems and brands, and the Seam API standardizes key functions.

***

## What Is an Access Control System?

Access control systems centralize access authorization for buildings, which means that you can use a single system to grant users access to one or more entrances. An access control system manages the following elements:

* Who has access
* The entrances to which users have access
* The access schedule for each user and entrance
* The access mechanism‚ÄîPIN codes, mobile keys, or plastic cards‚Äîfor each access grant

***

## Managing Your ACS with Seam

Seam enables you to manage your ACS in a logical, efficient manner.

1. Create ACS users.
2.  Configure access for your ACS users.

    For each user, specify the entrances to which the user has access and the schedule for this access.
3. Define credentials, which are the digital means of granting access, such as PIN codes, mobile keys, and plastic (RFID) cards.\
   If you are developing a mobile app to provide access for your ACS users, you can also use [Seam's iOS and Android SDKs](../../developer-tools/mobile-sdks/) that pair with the Seam API to create and manage mobile keys.

### Seam's API Handles ACS Differences

Seam's universal API provides the flexibility to manage a variety of [access control systems](../../capability-guides/access-systems/connect-an-acs-to-seam/understanding-access-control-system-differences.md), each of which may have manufacturer-specific differences. For example, depending on your ACS, you configure access permissions by [assigning ACS users to access groups](../../capability-guides/access-systems/connect-an-acs-to-seam/understanding-access-control-system-differences.md#access-group-based-access-control-systems) or by [specifying access permissions for each ACS user or credential](../../capability-guides/access-systems/connect-an-acs-to-seam/understanding-access-control-system-differences.md#credential-based-access-control-systems).

For details specific to your access control system, see the [system integration guide](../../device-and-system-integration-guides/overview.md#access-control-systems) for your ACS.

## **Getting Started**

Create your first credentials! See the [ACS Quick Starts](../../capability-guides/access-systems/acs-quick-starts/).
