# Step 1: Obtain ASSA ABLOY Certification for Your Mobile Key App

To launch your mobile app for issuing Visionline mobile keys into production, you must first obtain ASSA ABLOY certification. This certification process consists of the following steps:

* Answer a series of questions about your app. The categories of questions include app development and deployment, user authentication, credential issuance, mobile device handling, BLE reader integration, use cases, troubleshooting and support, and so on.
* Perform a set of pre-verification tests. Failing any of the pre-verification tests can result in a delay in the approval process.

Work with the ASSA ABLOY and Seam teams to achieve certification.

Once your app is certified, ASSA ABLOY provides you with a production Credential Services tenant account and production application ID for your mobile app. ASSA ABLOY gives you the following production details:

* Tenant account username
* Tenant account password
* Credential Services URL
* System ID
* Application ID
* Mobile access UUID

Use this information to configure Visionline for mobile access and to connect your production Visionline account to Seam.
