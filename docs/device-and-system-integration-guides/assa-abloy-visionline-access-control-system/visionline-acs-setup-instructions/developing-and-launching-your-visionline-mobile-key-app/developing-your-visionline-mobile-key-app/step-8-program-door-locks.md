# Step 8: Program Door Locks

Once you have [set up door locks](step-7-set-up-door-locks-with-ble-profiles.md) in the Visionline application, use the Lock Service 3G application to program the door locks themselves. When you program a lock, you download the identity and settings for the lock from Lock Service 3G to the lock.

{% hint style="info" %}
As part of its [mobile development course](step-1-complete-the-assa-abloy-mobile-development-course.md), ASSA ABLOY provides a demo lock that includes the required BLE module.
{% endhint %}

This process consists of the following basic steps:

1. [Install Lock Service 3G on a laptop or tablet.](step-8-program-door-locks.md#install-lock-service-3g)
2. [Configure the Visionline application to download door lock data to Lock Service 3G.](step-8-program-door-locks.md#configure-visionline-for-lock-service-3g)
3. [Configure Lock Service 3G to connect to the Visionline server.](step-8-program-door-locks.md#configure-lock-service-3g-to-connect-to-the-visionline-server)
4. [Download door lock data from the Visionline server to Lock Service 3G.](step-8-program-door-locks.md#download-door-lock-data-to-lock-service-3g)
5. [Initialize each door lock to program it with the correct settings.](step-8-program-door-locks.md#initialize-door-locks)

## Install Lock Service 3G

Install the Lock Service 3G on a Windows laptop or tablet that you can move to each door lock. You use an [RJ12 service cable](https://estore.assaabloyglobalsolutions.com/us/marine/service-cable-rj12-for-3g-rfid-lcu-e-cylinder.html) with an [RJ12 to USB adapter cable](https://estore.assaabloyglobalsolutions.com/us/marine/cable-rj12-to-usb-adapter-for-3g.html) to connect this laptop or tablet to each door lock.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the service cable with adapter cable does not work correctly, you may need to install the following driver:

`CDM v2.12.xx WHQL Certified.exe`
{% endhint %}
