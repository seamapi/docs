# Developing Your Visionline Plastic Card Encoding App Using a Real Visionline Server

You can use an unlicensed Visionline account to develop and test your Visionline plastic card encoding integration. Then, you can launch your app into production using a real Visionline site.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are some differences between using an unlicensed Visionline account and using a real, production Visionline site. Consequently, when you are ready to launch your app to production, make sure to follow the [instructions for launching](../launching-your-visionline-plastic-card-encoding-app-to-a-live-site/).
