# Developing and Launching Your Visionline Plastic Card Encoding App

You can use your own Visionline development account—that is, an unlicensed Visionline account—to develop your Visionline plastic card encoding app. If you do not have access to a Visionline development account, you can use a Seam sandbox workspace instead. Once you have developed and tested your app, launch it into production.

See the following instructions:
