# Developing Your Visionline Plastic Card Encoding App Using a Sandbox Workspace

If you do not have access to an unlicensed Visionline account, you can use a [sandbox workspace](../../../../../core-concepts/workspaces/#sandbox-workspaces) and Seam-provided virtual Visionline ACS to develop and test your Visionline plastic card encoding app. Seam sandbox workspaces provide test accounts and virtual devices and systems that you can connect and control. Importantly, virtual devices and systems behave identically to the corresponding real devices and systems.

For detailed instructions, see the following topics:
