# 2N System Set Up Instructions

## Prepare My2N Account for Seam Integration

{% hint style="warning" %}
To connect 2N devices to Seam, you must use a Company Admin account with multi-factor authentication (MFA) disabled.

If MFA is required for your admin account, create a separate account without MFA for dedicated API communication.
{% endhint %}

***

### Set up steps

1. **Create a My2N account**\
   [Sign up for a My2N account](https://my2n.com/2n-remote-configuration) if you don't already have one.
2. **Add your 2N devices**\
   In My2N, add your 2N IP devices to the account.
3. **Enable Remote API Access (RAA)**\
   Make sure Remote API Access (RAA) is enabled for your company. If it's not, contact [integrations@2n.com](mailto:integrations@2n.com) to activate it. Provide the company ID, which is locatd in the URL.

   * When prompted, log in with the deviceâ€™s credentials:

     * (Use custom credentials if they were changed during installation.)
2.  **Enable HTTP API services**

    * In the device dashboard, click **Services**.

## Connect Webview Instructions

The Seam Connect Webview is where you securely link your My2N account to Seam.

This connection lets Seam manage and update your 2N intercom devices.

1. **Select My2N**\
   In the Seam Connect Webview, select **My2N** from the list of brands available.
2.  **Enter your Company Admin credentials**

    * Enter the Company Admin My2N email and password for your propertyâ€™s My2N account, then click **Submit**.
    * **Note:** Use an account with multi-factor authentication (MFA) turned off. If your main admin account requires MFA, create a separate account without MFA for this connection.

3.  **Choose which devices to connect**\
    The Webview will show all 2N devices under your My2N company.

    If a device doesnâ€™t appear, check that itâ€™s been added and that the HTTP API is enabled.

    Select the devices you want to link to Seam, then click **Submit**.

4.  **Authorize device access**\
    For each selected device, enter the **Username** and **Password** you created in the [Enable HTTP API for Each Device](2n-system-set-up-instructions.md#enable-http-api-for-each-device) section.

    This step confirms that Seam can securely communicate with your 2N devices to perform actions like unlocking doors or managing access codes.
