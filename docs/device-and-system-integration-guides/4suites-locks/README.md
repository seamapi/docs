# 4SUITES Locks

## Overview

4SUITES produces cloud-managed Internet of Things (IoT) locks, lock upgrades, and readers for the hospitality industry. Because 4SUITES locks use IoT-enabled sensors, instead of relying on Bluetooth®, guests can use 4SUITES mobile keys through a webapp on a smartphone or other internet-connected device—without needing to download an app. Seam integrates with 4SUITES locks to provide streamlined hotel operations and improved guest access.
