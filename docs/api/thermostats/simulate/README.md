The Thermostat Simulations route contains the following resources:

## Endpoints

[**`/thermostats/simulate/hvac_mode_adjusted`**](./hvac_mode_adjusted.md)

Simulates having adjusted the [HVAC mode](../../../capability-guides/thermostats/understanding-thermostat-concepts/hvac-mode.md) for a [thermostat](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats). Only applicable for [sandbox devices](../../../core-concepts/workspaces/README.md#sandbox-workspaces). See also [Testing Your Thermostat App with Simulate Endpoints](../../../capability-guides/thermostats/testing-your-thermostat-app-with-simulate-endpoints.md).
[**`/thermostats/simulate/temperature_reached`**](./temperature_reached.md)

Simulates a [thermostat](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/thermostats) reaching a specified temperature. Only applicable for [sandbox devices](../../../core-concepts/workspaces/README.md#sandbox-workspaces). See also [Testing Your Thermostat App with Simulate Endpoints](../../../capability-guides/thermostats/testing-your-thermostat-app-with-simulate-endpoints.md).
