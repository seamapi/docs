# Delete a Connected Account

- [Request Parameters](#request-parameters)
- [Response](#response)

Deletes a specified [connected account](../../core-concepts/connected-accounts/README.md).

Deleting a connected account triggers a `connected_account.deleted` event and removes the connected account and all data associated with the connected account from Seam, including devices, events, access codes, and so on. For every deleted resource, Seam sends a corresponding deleted event, but the resource is not deleted from the provider.

For example, if you delete a connected account with a device that has an access code, Seam sends a `connected_account.deleted` event, a `device.deleted` event, and an `access_code.deleted` event, but Seam does not remove the access code from the device.
