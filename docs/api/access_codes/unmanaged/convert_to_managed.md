# Convert an Unmanaged Access Code

Converts an [unmanaged access code](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/migrating-existing-access-codes) to an [access code managed through Seam](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes).

An unmanaged access code has a limited set of operations that you can perform on it. Once you convert an unmanaged access code to a managed access code, the full set of access code operations and lifecycle events becomes available for it.

Note that not all device providers support converting an unmanaged access code to a managed access code.
