## The acs_system Object

- [Properties](./#properties)
- [Errors](./#errors)
- [Warnings](./#warnings)
- [Events](./#events)
- [Endpoints](./#endpoints)


Represents an [access control system](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/access-systems).

Within an `acs_system`, create [`acs_user`s](https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/acs/users#acs_user) and [`acs_credential`s](https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/acs/credentials#acs_credential) to grant access to the `acs_user`s.

For details about the resources associated with an access control system, see the [access control systems namespace](https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/acs).
