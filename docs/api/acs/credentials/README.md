## The acs_credential Object

- [Warnings](./#warnings)
- [Events](./#events)
- [Endpoints](./#endpoints)


Means by which an [access control system user](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/access-systems/user-management) gains access at an [entrance](../../../capability-guides/access-systems/retrieving-entrance-details.md). The `acs_credential` object represents a [credential](../../../capability-guides/access-systems/managing-credentials.md) that provides an ACS user access within an [access control system](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/access-systems).

An access control system generally uses digital means of access to authorize a user trying to get through a specific entrance. Examples of credentials include plastic key cards, mobile keys, biometric identifiers, and PIN codes. The electronic nature of these credentials, as well as the fact that access is centralized, enables both the rapid provisioning and rescinding of access and the ability to compile access audit logs.

For each `acs_credential`, you define the access method. You can also specify additional properties, such as a PIN code, depending on the credential type.
