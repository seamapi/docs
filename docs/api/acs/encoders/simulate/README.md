### [`/acs/encoders/simulate/next_credential_encode_will_fail`](./next_credential_encode_will_fail.md)

Simulates that the next attempt to encode a [credential](../../../../capability-guides/access-systems/managing-credentials.md) using the specified [encoder](../../../../capability-guides/access-systems/working-with-card-encoders-and-scanners/README.md) will fail. You can only perform this action within a [sandbox workspace](../../../../core-concepts/workspaces/README.md#sandbox-workspaces).
### [`/acs/encoders/simulate/next_credential_encode_will_succeed`](./next_credential_encode_will_succeed.md)

Simulates that the next attempt to encode a [credential](../../../../capability-guides/access-systems/managing-credentials.md) using the specified [encoder](../../../../capability-guides/access-systems/working-with-card-encoders-and-scanners/README.md) will succeed. You can only perform this action within a [sandbox workspace](../../../../core-concepts/workspaces/README.md#sandbox-workspaces).
### [`/acs/encoders/simulate/next_credential_scan_will_fail`](./next_credential_scan_will_fail.md)

Simulates that the next attempt to scan a [credential](../../../../capability-guides/access-systems/managing-credentials.md) using the specified [encoder](../../../../capability-guides/access-systems/working-with-card-encoders-and-scanners/README.md) will fail. You can only perform this action within a [sandbox workspace](../../../../core-concepts/workspaces/README.md#sandbox-workspaces).
