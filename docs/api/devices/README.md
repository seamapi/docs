**`capabilities_supported`** _List_ _of Enums_

Collection of capabilities that the device supports when connected to Seam. Values are `access_code`, which indicates that the device can manage and utilize digital PIN codes for secure access; `lock`, which indicates that the device controls a door locking mechanism, enabling the remote opening and closing of doors and other entry points; `noise_detection`, which indicates that the device supports monitoring and responding to ambient noise levels; `thermostat`, which indicates that the device can regulate and adjust indoor temperatures; `battery`, which indicates that the device can manage battery life and health; and `phone`, which indicates that the device is a mobile device, such as a smartphone. **Important:** Superseded by [capability flags](../../capability-guides/device-and-system-capabilities.md#capability-flags).

***

**`connected_account_id`** _UUID_

Unique identifier for the account associated with the device.

***

**`created_at`** _Datetime_

Date and time at which the device object was created.

***

**`custom_metadata`** _Record_

Set of key:value pairs. Adding custom metadata to a resource, such as a [Connect Webview](../../core-concepts/connect-webviews/attaching-custom-data-to-the-connect-webview.md), [connected account](../../core-concepts/connected-accounts/adding-custom-metadata-to-a-connected-account.md), or [device](../../core-concepts/devices/adding-custom-metadata-to-a-device.md), enables you to store custom information, like customer details or internal IDs from your application.

***

**`device_id`** _UUID_

ID of the device.

***

**`device_type`** _Enum_

Type of the device.

***

**`display_name`** _String_

Display name of the device, defaults to nickname (if it is set) or `properties.appearance.name`, otherwise. Enables administrators and users to identify the device easily, especially when there are numerous devices.

***

[**`errors`**](./#errors) _List_ _of Objects_

Array of errors associated with the device. Each error object within the array contains two fields: `error_code` and `message`. `error_code` is a string that uniquely identifies the type of error, enabling quick recognition and categorization of the issue. `message` provides a more detailed description of the error, offering insights into the issue and potentially how to rectify it.

The specific structure of each object in this list depends on the value of its `error_code` field.
