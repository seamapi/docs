# Sandbox Latch Access Control System

You do not need to specify any credentials to add a virtual [Latch access control system](../../device-and-system-integration-guides/latch-access-control-system-1/) to your Seam [sandbox workspace](../../core-concepts/workspaces/#sandbox-workspaces).

To add a sandbox Latch access control system using the Seam Console:

1. In the left navigation pane of the [Seam Console](https://console.seam.co/), click **Access Systems**.
2. In the upper-right corner of the **Access Systems** page, click **+ New Access System** to display a Connect Webview.
3. Complete the Connect Webview, making sure to select **Latch** as the access control system that you want to add.\
   For a sandbox Latch access control system, you do not need to contact Seam to complete the connection.
