The Seam Command Line Interface (CLI) is a fully interactive CLI version of the Seam API. You can [install the Seam CLI locally](seam-cli.md#install-the-seam-cli) or use the [Seam Online CLI](../core-concepts/seam-console/seam-online-cli.md) within the [Seam Console](../core-concepts/seam-console/). Quick, intuitive, and easy to use, the Seam CLI enables you to perform a variety of useful tasks, including the following:

* Explore and test all the available methods in the Seam API interactively.
* View resources or test API functions easily and quickly.
* Inspect the results of your API commands.
* Access Seam API functionality that is not currently available in the Seam Console.
