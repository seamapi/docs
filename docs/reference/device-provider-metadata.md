  Device provider metadata is used to provide data on a device that can't be or
  hasn't yet been standardized across all providers.

# Device Provider Metadata

When integrating with a device provider, Seam adds any information that doesn't fit nicely into a cross-provider standard field into the provider metadata for a device. Device provider metadata can be found on an object on devices named like so:

&#x20;`device.properties.PROVIDER_metadata`

Examples of provider metadata include `august_metadata`, `schlage_metadata` and `lockly_metadata`.

Sometimes provider metadata contains fields where Seam is still coming up with a standard representation, so you can use these fields to "get ahead" of Seam's standardized implementation.

## Getting Provider Metadata

To access provider metadata, make any call that returns device properties. Here are some examples of how you can get August metadata for a variety of SDKs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Provider metadata is available in sandboxes, so if you want to see typical examples of provider metadata, you can just create a webview and connect devices in a sandbox workspace to read the properties.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="HTTP" %}
```bash
curl \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer MY_API_KEY' \
  https://connect.getseam.com/devices/list
  
#{
#  "devices": [
#    {
#      "device_id": "3c196474-d2eb-4e07-b1d0-e2996eeb40d0",
#      "device_type": "smartthings_lock",
#      "properties": {
#        "smartthings_metadata": {
#          "model": "0129-8002-0600",
#          "device_id": "750ed15f-93f2-4ff1-8944-47e93b10f7d6",
#          "device_name": "Yale Door Lock"
#        },
# ...
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Javascript" %}
```javascript
const devices = await seam.devices.list()

console.log(devices[0].properties.smartthings_metadata)
/*
{
  "model": "0129-8002-0600",
  "device_id": "750ed15f-93f2-4ff1-8944-47e93b10f7d6",
  "device_name": "Yale Door Lock"
}
*/
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Provider Metadata Definitions

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not use `PROVIDER_metadata.model`, `model` is being deprecated for a standardized model object across providers, and is likely to be changed or removed in the future.
{% endhint %}
