# Hospitality Industry Guide

## Overview

This guide shows how to use the Seam API to build access control features into your hospitality app, like issuing mobile keys, Instant Keys, and plastic cards.

Seam enables you to grant and manage access to buildings, such as hotels, and much more. We integrate with multiple access systems and brands—both cloud-based and on-premises—and the Seam API standardizes key functions.

As modern hospitality PMSs, you need to develop SaaS apps that integrate with your hotel partners' multiple access systems and issue access credentials for their hotel guests. Seam enables you to improve front desk and hotel efficiency, while enhancing the guest experience.

With Seam, you can create self-check-in solutions that grant access using the following access modes:

* Instant Keys (No app download required, fully-hosted)
* Mobile keys
* Apple Wallet keys
* Plastic card encoding
* PIN codes

Seam also enables you to build efficient front desk dashboards to help you streamline front desk workflows and reduce errors. For example:

* Create a portal for agents to encode cards.
* Feed in reservation data automatically so that there are fewer errors.
* Create a user-friendly UI that reduces the learning curve for employees.
