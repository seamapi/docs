# Seam API Overview

Seam provides a single unified API to grant and manage access across all supported hotel access systems. Intuitive and flexible, the Seam API makes it easy to grant access, no matter what type of device or system controls this access.

If you want the easiest, most efficient way to grant access, use the [Access Grants](../../capability-guides/access-grants/) API. This powerful API enables you to grant hotel guests access with a single call—for any access method. With this single API, you can…

* Grant access to the desired set of guest rooms and relevant common areas.
* Support mixed hardware environments without extra logic.
* Simplify onboarding and reduce maintenance as you scale.

This unified approach means that you can build access workflows once and rely on them to work everywhere.

If you need more granular control, the Seam API provides lower-level API resources and endpoints as well. In this case, use the Seam [access control system](../../products/access-systems/) (ACS) API.

## Mapping Your Resources to Seam

Seam makes it easy to tag Seam resources with your own internal IDs. Use resource keys to map your own data—such as rooms, reservations, and so on—to the corresponding Seam resources. In addition, you can link your own customers with the Connect Webviews and resulting connected accounts that they use to connect their systems and devices to Seam.

For details, see [Mapping Your Resources to Seam Resources](../../core-concepts/mapping-your-resources-to-seam-resources.md).
