# Customer Portals

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/portal.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Provide self-service functions to your customers by setting up a customer portal. You can configure it entirely in the Console, or use our API to automate generating the portal.

You can extend the portal experience with [Seam access and climate automations](../reservation-automations.md). When a customer books a stay, reserves a gym slot, or schedules a visit, automations automatically issue and revoke access or adjust climate settings. You create and manage them in the Console.

### Get started with the customer portal

### Customer portal features

A customer portal allows your customers to self-manage connecting devices, manage their devices, and  handle day-to-day management in one place.
