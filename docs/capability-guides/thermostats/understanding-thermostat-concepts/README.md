# Understanding Thermostat Concepts

To manage your thermostats effectively with Seam, it is important to understand the following concepts:

*   [HVAC mode](hvac-mode.md)

    The `hvac_mode_setting` governs the operation of your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to achieve and maintain your preferred temperature.
*   [Set points](set-points.md)

    Temperature set points for a thermostat control the target temperatures that the thermostat activates the heating or cooling system to reach.
