# ðŸ“‹ Device and System Capabilities

Each device that you connect to Seam has a specific set of capabilities. These capabilities define the Seam API actions that you can use. For example, some devices support [remote unlock actions](../products/smart-locks/lock-and-unlock.md), while others support [programming access codes](../products/smart-locks/access-codes/). Some devices support both of these capabilities. When developing your application, it is imperative to be able to identify the capabilities of each device.

For example, if a device supports programming online access codes, your app can present the [`CreateAccessCodeForm` Seam Component](../seam-components/react-components/create-access-code-form.md) to your user. On the other hand, if a connected device does not support the remote unlock action, you'll likely want to disable or not display the unlock functionality for your app user.

## Capability Flags

Capability flags inform your application about what features and behaviors each device supports. That is, you can use capability flags to match devices to the requirements for operations within your app. These flags also compare the capabilities of a specific device instance with those of the device model in general.

All capability flags share the following behavior:

* If `true`, the device has this capability, and this capability is functional on this device instance.
*   If `false`, the device has this capability, but the capability is not currently functional.

    See the device [errors](<../api-clients/devices/README (1).md#device-error-types>) and [warnings](<../api-clients/devices/README (1).md#device-warning-types>) for more details about the cause of this issue. You can also examine the [properties](<../api-clients/devices/README (1).md#device-properties>) of the device and [events](../api-clients/events/#event-types) related to the device to learn more about the cause of this issue.
* If not present, the device does not have this capability.

Reasons why a capability flag might be `false` could include that the device is currently offline or that a required hardware accessory is not connected to the device.

Seam recommends adding capability checks before performing specific actions in your app. For example, before performing a [remote unlock](../products/smart-locks/lock-and-unlock.md#unlocking-a-door) operation, you can check to make sure that the target device supports remote unlocking. For details and code samples, see the corresponding [capability guides](broken-reference/).

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to viewing the capabilities for a specific device, you can also view the capabilities for a provider using [List Device Providers](../api-clients/devices/list\_device\_providers.md). If at least one supported device from a provider has a specific capability, the corresponding capability flag is `true`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Seam is actively developing additional capability flags to provide you with even more robust capability checking abilities for your app. If you would like us to add a specific capability flag, contact [support@seam.co](mailto:support@seam.co).
