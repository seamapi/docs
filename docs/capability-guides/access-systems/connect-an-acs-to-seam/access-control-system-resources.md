# Access Control System Resources

The Seam ACS schema consists of a series of resources. These resources interact intuitively, enabling you to manage your ACS in a logical, efficient manner. Seam's universal API provides the flexibility to manage a variety of [ACSs](understanding-access-control-system-differences.md), each of which may have manufacturer-specific differences. For details about your ACS, see the corresponding [system integration guide](../../../device-and-system-integration-guides/overview.md#access-control-systems).

The following diagram shows an example of one ACS, including the ACS resources and the relationships between them:

The following table provides a brief description of each of the Seam ACS resources:

{% hint style="info" %}
You configure the access schedules for your ACS users either through access groups or credentials, depending on your specific ACS. There is no separate schedule resource in the Seam API.
