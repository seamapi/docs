These quick starts introduce you to the Seam ACS resources and processes using specific supported access control systems as examples. Note that there are often differences between access control systems. Once you've completed the quick starts, learn how to work with your ACS using Seam, by reading the [system integration guide](../../../device-and-system-integration-guides/overview.md#access-control-systems) for your ACS.
