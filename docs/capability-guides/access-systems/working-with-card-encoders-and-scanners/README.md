# Working with Card Encoders and Scanners

Some access control systems require credentials to be [encoded onto plastic key cards](creating-and-encoding-card-based-credentials.md) using a card encoder. This process involves the following two key steps:

1.  Credential creation

    Configure the access parameters for the credential.
2.  Card encoding

    Write the credential data onto the card using a compatible card encoder.

Separately, the Seam API also supports [card scanning](scanning-encoded-cards.md), which enables you to scan and read the encoded data on a card. You can use this action to confirm consistency with ACS records or diagnose discrepancies if needed.

To verify if your ACS requires a card encoder, see the [system integration guide](../../../products/access-systems/) for your ACS.
