# Events

Events let you know when something interesting happens in your workspace. When an interesting event occurs, Seam creates a new `Event` object. For example, when a lock is unlocked, Seam creates a `lock.unlocked` event. When a device's battery level is low, Seam creates a `device.battery_low` event.

As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](get.md) or a [list of events](list.md). Seam also provides a separate [webhook](../../core-concepts/webhooks.md) system for sending the `event` objects directly to an endpoint on your sever. Manage webhooks through the [Seam Console](../../core-concepts/seam-console/). For details, see [Webhooks](../../core-concepts/webhooks.md).
