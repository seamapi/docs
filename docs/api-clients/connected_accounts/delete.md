# Delete a Connected Account

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a connected account triggers a `connected_account.deleted` event and removes the connected account and all data associated with the connected account from Seam, including devices, events, access codes, and so on. For every deleted resource, Seam sends a corresponding deleted event, but the resource is not deleted from the provider.

For example, if you delete a connected account with a device that has an access code, Seam sends a `connected_account.deleted` event, a `device.deleted` event, and an `access_code.deleted` event,
but Seam does not remove the access code from the device.
