{% hint style="info" %}
An **Ongoing** Access Code will be active until it has been removed from the Device. Be sure to leave both the **`starts_at`** and **`ends_at`** fields empty to specify an ongoing Access Code.

A **Time Bound** Access Code will be programmed at the \*\*`starts_at`\*\*time, and removed at the **`ends_at`** time.
{% endhint %}

### Access Code Names

Note that the `name` provided on Seam is used to identify the code on Seam, and is not necessarily the name that will appear on the lock provider's app, or on the device. This is because lock providers may have constraints on names such as length, uniqueness or characters that can be used. In addition, some lock providers may break down names into components such as `first_name` and `last_name`.

In order to provide a consistent experience, Seam will identify the code on Seam by its `name` but may modify the name that appears on the lock provider's app, or on the device. For example, Seam may add additional characters or truncate the name in order to meet provider constraints.

In order to help end users identify codes set by Seam, Seam provides the name exactly as it appears on the lock provider's app, or on the device as a separate property called `appearance`. This is an object with a `name` property, and optionally, `first_name` and `last_name` properties (for providers that break down a name into components).

## External Modification

Seam will attempt to keep the access code on the device in sync with the declared state of the access code on Seam. For example, the start time and end time of the access code will be set to match the declared state of the access code on Seam. Any updates to the access code timings on Seam will be reflected on the device. In general, if the access code is modified external to Seam (through the lock provider's app for example), Seam will attempt to re-set the access code on the device to match the declared state of the access code on Seam. This also applies if the access code is removed from the device. Seam will attempt to re-set the access code on the device until the declared ending time of the access code has passed.

When external modifications are detected, Seam will send an `access_code.modified_external_to_seam` event and add a `code_modified_external_to_seam` error on the access code.

This behavior can sometimes be surprising to end users, so we recommend that you inform your users that Seam will attempt to re-set access codes on the device if they are modified or removed externally. If you would like to disable this behavior, you can set the `allow_external_modification` flag to true when an access code. When this flag is set to true, Seam will set `code_modified_external_to_seam` as a warning on the code instead of an error.

### Access Code Error Types

Errors are returned in a list:

```
"errors": [
  {
    "is_access_code_error": true,
    "error_code": "device_disconnected",
    "message": "Device Disconnected, you may need to reconnect the device.",
    "created_at": "2023-06-27T22:50:19.440Z
  }
]
```

#### Generic Errors

Seam recommends adding error handling logic to you application for each generic error below. Seam may add more generic errors in the future, so your application should include a fallback case if it encounters an unknown generic error code.

See our [troubleshooting tips for access codes](../../products/smart-locks/access-codes/troubleshooting-access-code-issues.md) for our recommended responses to these error codes.

| Error Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `failed_to_set_on_device`              | An error occurred when we tried to set the access code on the device. We will continue to try and set the code on the device in case the error was temporary.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `failed_to_remove_from_device`         | An error occurred when we tried to remove the access code from the device. We will continue to try and remove the code from the device in case the error was temporary.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `code_modified_external_to_seam`       | We detected that the code was modified or removed externally after Seam successfully set it on the device. We will attempt to set the code on the device again. Please advise the user that Seam will re-set codes they modify or remove manually, and to review other lock integrations that may be modifying the codes. |
| `conflicting_unmanaged_access_code_id` | An access code called "Foo bar" with the same pin already exists on the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Specific Errors

When Seam is able to provide more specific information beyond one of the generic errors above, one or more errors from the list of specific errors may appear. This gives your application the option to display additional context or suggest provider specific resolutions.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the device or connected account associated with an access code has an error, it will be attached to the access code alongside any other access code errors. Treat these errors as Specific Errors. See [Device Error Types](../devices/#device-error-types) and [Connected Account Error Types](../connected-accounts/#connected-account-error-types).

| `kwikset_unable_to_confirm_deletion`               | Unable to confirm deletion of the access code from the Kwikset device. It's possible that this access code was deleted from a source other than Seam.

### Access Code Warnings

{% hint style="info" %}
An access code can have more than one error or warning.
{% endhint %}

Warnings are returned in a list:

```
"warnings": [
  {
    "warning_code": "delay_in_removing_from_device ",
    "message": "We expected the device to report that the access code has been removed but it still has not.",
    "created_at": "2023-06-27T22:50:19.440Z
  }
]
```

| Warning Type                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delay_in_removing_from_device`  | We expected the device to report that the access code has been removed but it still has not. We will continue to try and remove the code from the device.                                                                                       |
| `delay_in_setting_on_device`     | There was an unusually long delay in programming the code onto the device. For time bound codes, this is sent when the code enters its active time. Note that this is a temporary warning and might be removed if the code is successfully set. |
| `code_modified_external_to_seam` | When we detect that a code was modified or removed externally after Seam successfully set it on the device, and the `allow_external_modification` flag is set for the code, we will set this warning instead of an error.                       |
