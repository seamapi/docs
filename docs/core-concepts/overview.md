# Overview

Seam enables you to connect to, operate, and manage different brands of devices using the following basic concepts:

1. Your Seam account has one or more [workspaces](workspaces/) that encapsulate all resources.
2. You use [Connect Webviews](../capability-guides/device-and-system-capabilities/connect-webviews/) to connect devices to your workspace.
3. You control those devices according to their [capabilities](../capability-guides/device-and-system-capabilities/).
4. You use [Seam Console](seam-console/) to manage your Seam workspaces, Connect Webviews, devices, and systems; [create API keys](authentication/api-keys.md#create-an-api-key); and perform other tasks.
