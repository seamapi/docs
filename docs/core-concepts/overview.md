# Overview

Seam enables you to connect to, operate, and manage different brands of devices using the following basic concepts:

1. Your Seam account has one or more [workspaces](workspaces/) that encapsulate all resources.
2. You use [Connect Webviews](connect-webviews/) to connect devices to your workspace.
3. You control those devices according to their [capabilities](../capability-guides/device-and-system-capabilities.md).
4. You use the [Seam Console](seam-console/) to manage your Seam workspaces, Connect Webviews, and devices; [create API keys](authentication/api-keys.md#create-an-api-key); and perform other tasks.
