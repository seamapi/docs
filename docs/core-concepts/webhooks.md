# Webhooks

A webhook is an HTTP callback that you configure with an external service. When a specific event occurs, the service sends an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload to the URL you provide. This allows you to receive real-time notifications and process events immediately.

## Configuring Webhooks

You can configure endpoints in each workspace for your app to receive event notifications for resources like devices and connected accounts.

**To configure webhook endpoints:**

1. **Access the Webhooks Section:**
In the left navigation pane of the Seam Console, click Webhooks.

2. **Add a New Webhook:**
Click + Add Webhook.

3. **Enter the Webhook Details:**
- In the Create Webhook dialog, type your public webhook URL.
- Select the event types (for example, device.connected or device.low_battery) for which you want to receive events.

4. **Secure Your Webhook:**
Click Create. Copy your webhook secret and store it somewhere secure; you will use this secret to validate the payloads received at your endpoint.

5. **Test Your Webhook:** You can test your endpoint using external tools such as [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/webhook-integration/) and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

> **Note:** When using external tools, use them carefully and ensure that you do not expose sensitive information or compromise your systemâ€™s security.

You can add webhooks through the Seam Console or programmatically. Let's start by looking at how to add and test a webhook using the Seam Console.

You can specify any public URL endpoint to receive webhook events by pasting the URL into the **Create Webhook** dialog.

Webhook endpoints can receive many different types of events, such as `device.connected` or `device.low_battery`. It's a good idea when getting started with webhooks to review the list of webhook [event types](../api-clients/events/#event-types) and test your endpoint using the Svix sandbox environment.

You can view all the event types and the included fields in the **Event Catalog** tab.

We use webhooks from Svix. For more information about consuming events, such as testing or verifying webhooks, see the [Svix docs](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/introduction).

## Webhook Security

Seam webhooks are signed using an HMAC with SHA-256. If you wish to verify those signatures on your end, contact our team.

**Signature Verification**

- **Webhook Secret:** Use the webhook secret from your configuration to verify that incoming payloads are genuine.
- **Signature Header:** Look for a signature header (e.g., X-Signature) in each request. Compute an HMAC (using SHA-256, for example) from the payload and compare it with the signature.

**Example (Node.js):**

```
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(secret, payload, signature) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(payload);
  const digest = hmac.digest('hex');
  return digest === signature;
}
```


## Handling Failures and Retries

Your webhook endpoint must be able to handle failures gracefully. If an event delivery fails (for example, due to a non-2xx HTTP status code), Seam automatically retries delivery using an exponential backoff schedule.

### Retry Schedule

The following table outlines the retry delays after each failed attempt:

| Attempt         | Delay After Previous Attempt |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 (Initial)     | Immediately                   |
| 2               | 5 seconds                     |
| 3               | 5 minutes                     |
| 4               | 30 minutes                    |
| 5               | 2 hours                       |
| 6               | 5 hours                       |
| 7               | 10 hours                      |
| 8               | 10 additional hours           |

Example: If an event fails three times and then succeeds, the final successful delivery will occur roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds after the first attempt.
