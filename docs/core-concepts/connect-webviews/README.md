## What are Connect Webviews?

Seam Connect Webviews are fully-embedded, [customizable](customizing-connect-webviews.md) client-side components that you [add to your app](embedding-a-connect-webview-in-your-app.md) if you want to enable your users to import their own devices or ACS using your app. The Connect Webview flow walks your users through the process of authorizing your app to control their devices or ACS with the Seam API. Using this flow, your app users log in to their device or ACS accounts.

Seam handles all the authentication steps, andâ€”once your user has completed the authorization through your appâ€”you can access and control their devices or ACS using the Seam API. Connect Webviews perform credential validation, multifactor authentication (when applicable), and error handling for each brand that Seam supports. Further, Connect Webviews work across all modern browsers and platforms, including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
