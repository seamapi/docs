# Get started with Schlage Locks

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/schlage-getting-started-guide-cover.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Schlage Smart Locks</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Seam provides a universal API to connect and control many brands of smart locks. This guide provides a rapid introduction to connecting and controlling your [Schlage](https://www.seam.co/manufacturers/schlage) lock using the Seam API. Note that this guide is intended for Schlage Sense locks and Schlage Encode locks that connect to wifi. For Z-Wave Schlage locks such as Schlage Connect, head over to [our guide for SmartThings](get-started-with-smartthings-hubs-+-smart-locks.md).

To learn more about other smart lock brands supported by Seam such as August, Yale, and Salto, head over to our [integration page](https://www.seam.co/supported-devices-and-systems).

## 1 — Install Seam SDK

Seam provides client libraries for many languages, such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, and others, as well as a Postman collection and [OpenAPI](https://connect.getseam.com/openapi.json) spec.

* JavaScript / TypeScript ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seam), [GitHub](https://github.com/seamapi/javascript))
* Python ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/seam/), [GitHub](https://github.com/seamapi/python))
* Ruby Gem ([rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/seam), [GitHub](https://github.com/seamapi/ruby))
* PHP ([packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/seamapi/seam), [GitHub](https://github.com/seamapi/php))
* C# ([nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Seam), [GitHub](https://github.com/seamapi/csharp))

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```bash
npm i seam
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```bash
pip install seam
# For some development environments, use pip3 in this command instead of pip.
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ruby" %}
```bash
bundle add seam
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PHP" %}
```bash
composer require seamapi/seam
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C#" %}
Install using [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Seam).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Once installed, [sign-up for Seam](https://console.seam.co/) to get your API key, and export it as an environment variable:

```
$ export SEAM_API_KEY=seam_test2ZTo_0mEYQW2TvNDCxG5Atpj85Ffw
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide uses a Sandbox Workspace. Only virtual devices can be connected. If you need to connect a real Schlage Lock, use a non-sandbox workspace and API key.
{% endhint %}

## 2 — Link Schlage Account with Seam

To control your Schlage lock via the Seam API, you must first authorize your Seam workspace against your Schlage account. To do so, Seam provides[ Connect Webviews](../core-concepts/connect-webviews/): pre-built UX flows that walk you through authorizing your application to control your Schlage lock.

#### Request a Connect Webview

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
from seam import Seam

seam = Seam()

webview = seam.connect_webviews.create(accepted_providers=["schlage"])

assert webview.login_successful is False

# Send the webview URL to your user
print(webview.url)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Javascript" %}
```javascript
import { Seam } from 'seam'

const seam = new Seam()

const { connect_webview: connectWebview } = await seam.connectWebviews.create({
  accepted_providers: ['schlage'],
})

console.log(connectWebview.login_successful) // false

// Send the webview URL to your user
console.log(connectWebview.url)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ruby" %}
```ruby
require "seam"

seam = Seam.new(api_key: "MY_API_KEY")

webview = seam.connect_webviews.create(
  accepted_providers: ["schlage"]
)

puts webview.login_successful # false

# Send the webview URL to your user
puts webview.url
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Authorize Your Workspace

Navigate to the URL returned by the Webview object. Since you are using a sandbox workspace, complete the login flow by entering the Schlage [sandbox test accounts ](https://docs.seam.co/latest/device-guides/sandbox-and-sample-data)credentials below:

* **email:** jane@example.com
* **password:** 1234
* **2-factor-auth:** 123456

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/connect-flow-screens (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Seam Connect Webview flow to connect Schlage account with Seam</p></figcaption></figure>

Confirm the Connect Webview was successful by querying its status:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
updated_webview = seam.connect_webviews.get(connect_webview_id: webview.connect_webview_id)

assert updated_webview.login_successful # true
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Javascript" %}
```javascript
const updatedWebview = await seam.connectWebviews.get(
  connectWebview.connect_webview_id,
)

console.log(updatedWebview.login_successful) // true
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ruby" %}
```ruby
updated_webview = seam.connect_webviews.get(connect_webview_id: webview.connect_webview_id)

puts updated_webview.login_successful # true
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 3 — Retrieve Schlage Lock Devices

After a Schlage account is linked with Seam, you can retrieve devices for this Schlage account. The Seam API exposes most of the device's properties such as battery level or door lock status.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`python all\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_locks = seam.locks.list()

some\_lock = all\_locks\[0]

assert some\_lock.properties\["online"] is True assert some\_lock.properties\["locked"] is True

print(some\_lock)

```python
# Device(device_id='e2d95c42-b2bf-4d07-9211-7407d9c90c73',
#   device_type='schlage_lock',
#   location=None,
#   properties={
#     'locked': True,
#     'online': True,
#     'manufacturer': 'schlage',
#     'battery_level': 0.48,
#     'schlage_metadata': {'device_id': 'device-1', 'device_name': 'FRONT DOOR', 'access_code_length': 4}, 'name': 'FRONT DOOR'
#   },
#   capabilities_supported=['access_code', 'lock'])
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Javascript" %}

``javascript
const allLocks = await seam.locks.list()

const someLock = allLocks[0]

console.log(someLock.properties.online) // true
console.log(someLock.properties.locked) // true

console.log(someLock)
/*

### 4 — Locking & Unlocking a Door

Next, you can perform the basic action of locking and unlocking the door.

<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="openapi" data-src='../.gitbook/assets/openapi.json' data-path='/locks/lock_door' data-method='post'>

[openapi.json](../.gitbook/assets/openapi.json)

</div>

## Unlock a door

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://connect.getseam.com/locks/unlock_door`

#### Request Body

# Now unlock the door
seam.locks.unlock_door(device_id: some_lock.device_id)
updated_lock = seam.locks.get(device_id: some_lock.device_id)

### 5 — Setting Access Code on Schlage Lock

All Schlage wifi locks come with a keypad built-in to program access codes. These codes can then be entered to unlock a Schlage lock.

The Seam API makes it easy to program both `ongoing` codes and `timebound` codes on a Schlage lock. You can find out more about Schlage lock access code in our [core concept section on access codes.](../products/smart-locks/access-codes/)

<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="tabs">

<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="tab" data-title='Python'>

```python
# create an ongoing code
seam.access_codes.create(
    device=some_lock, code="123456", name="Personal Access Code"
)

# create a timebound code
seam.access_codes.create(
    device=some_lock,
    code="888888",
    name="My Temp Access Code",
    starts_at="2028-08-12T19:23:42+0000",
    ends_at="2028-08-13T19:23:42+0000"
)

# you can use a device or a device_id as the "device" parameter
seam.access_codes.list(device=some_lock)
# [
#   AccessCode(
#     access_code_id='af5272b1-2a49-4eb5-9388-2447fc7b5bd1',
#     type='ongoing',
#     code='123459'

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed this guide, you can try to connect a real Schlage device. To do so, make sure to switch to a non-sandbox workspace and API key as real devices cannot be connected to sandbox workspaces.
