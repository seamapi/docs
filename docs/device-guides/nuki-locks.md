# Nuki Locks

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/nuki-manufacturer-page-cover-light.png" alt="Use Nuki locks with Seam."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Nuki produces a smart lock and accompanying products for the residential, rental, vacation rental, and corporate markets. Seam integrates directly with the Wi-Fi-enabled Nuki Smart Lock Pro, as well as with the Nuki Smart Lock through the Nuki Wi-Fi Bridge. Because Nuki Smart Locks attach to existing deadbolts, they replace only the lock components on the insides of doors.

Seam also supports the Nuki Keypad accessory for access code-based entry. In addition, the Nuki Opener works with the Nuki Bridge to control the intercom in a multi-unit building. In this way, Nuki products provide keyless access all the way from the street.

***

## Supported Devices

This integration supports all Nuki Smart Lock and Nuki Opener models that are connected to Wi-Fi, either through built-in Wi-Fi or using the [Nuki Bridge](https://nuki.io/en/bridge/). Seam also supports the addition of the optional [Nuki Keypad](https://nuki.io/en/keypad-code/) to enable entering access codes to control the lock or opener.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must purchase [Nuki Smart Hosting](https://nuki.io/en-us/products/smart-hosting-service) for each of your Nuki locks to enable you to program access codes on these Nuki locks through Seam.
