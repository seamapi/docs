### Device Provider Key

To create a [Connect Webview](../core-concepts/connect-webviews/) that enables you to connect your Hubitat Hub and devices to Seam, include the `hubitat` [device provider key](../api-clients/connect-webviews/#device-provider-keys) as the `selected_provider` or in the `accepted_providers` list. For more information, see [Customize the Brands to Display in Your Connect Webview](../core-concepts/connect-webviews/customizing-connect-webviews.md#customize-the-brands-to-display-in-your-connect-webviews).

## Setup Instructions

To control Hubitat Hub-connected devices using Seam, you must prompt owners of these devices to perform the following steps:

### 1. Access the Hubitat Hub Dashboard

* [Follow these instructions to get access to the Hubitat Hub's Dashboard.](https://docs2.hubitat.com/getting-started/registration-and-setup)

### 2. Configure the "Type" of the Device

* From the Hubitat Hub dashboard, click on "Devices" in the left navigation.
* In the "Device Information" section, click on "Type", and select the correct device type of the device.

### 3. Turn on Hub Login Security (IMPORTANT)

This prevents other people on the same network as that of the hub from being able to log in to the dashboard and modify your settings.

* From the Hubitat Hub dashboard, click on "Settings" in the left navigation
* In the "Admin Settings" section, click on "Hub Login Security".
* Click on "Add User"
* Fill in the form with a username, email, and password, and make sure to save this information somewhere. You'll be using these credentials to log in to your dashboard in the future.

### 4.  Adding the Maker API App for Seam access

* From the Hubitat Hub dashboard, click on "Apps" in the left navigation
* Click on "Add Built-In App" on the top right corner
* Click on the "Maker API" app to install it
* Under the "Security" section:
  * Enable "Allow Access via Remote / Cloud"
  * Disable "Allow Access via Local IP / Address"
* Under "Select Devices", check the checkboxes of all the devices you want to connect with Seam
* Under the "Cloud URLS:" section, copy the "Get Device Info" Cloud URL, and save it. You'll be using this URL to connect the hub to Seam.

### 5. Adding your account via Seam Connect Webview

Use the Cloud URL you collected in the previous step to connect your account.
