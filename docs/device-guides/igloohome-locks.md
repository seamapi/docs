# igloohome Locks

## Overview

igloohome produces various types of smart locks for the residential, rental property, and small business markets. These locks include mortise, deadbolt, rim, glass door, keybox, and padlock style locks.

Seam integrates with igloohome locks through the [igloohome Wi-Fi Bridge](https://www.igloohome.co/en-US/products/bridge) to provide lock, unlock, and customizable access code provisioning actions. You can link up to five igloohome locks with a single igloohome Bridge.

In addition, the Seam integration supports the generation of [offline access codes](../device-and-system-integration-guides/igloohome-locks/creating-igloohome-offline-access-codes.md) (that is, igloohome [algoPINâ„¢](https://www.igloohome.co/en-US/how-it-works) codes) for igloohome locks without the need for the igloohome Bridge.

## Supported Devices

This integration supports a series of igloohome devices for lock, unlock, and customizable access code provisioning actions. In addition, this integration supports a wider set of igloohome devices for offline access code (algoPIN) provisioning.

### igloohome Bridge Support

This integration supports lock, unlock, and customizable access code provisioning actions for a subset of igloohome smart locks, when combined with the [igloohome Bridge](https://www.igloohome.co/en-US/products/bridge).

### Device Provider Key

To create a [Connect Webview](../core-concepts/connect-webviews/) that enables your users to connect their igloohome devices to Seam, include the `igloohome` [device provider key](../api-clients/connect-webviews/#device-provider-keys) in the `accepted_providers` list. For more information, see [Customize the Brands to Display in Your Connect Webview](../core-concepts/connect-webviews/customizing-connect-webviews.md#customize-the-brands-to-display-in-your-connect-webviews).

## Setup Instructions

To control igloohome devices using Seam, you must prompt owners of these devices to perform the following steps:

1. Create an account in the igloohome mobile app if you have not done so already.\
   For more information, see "Download App & Sign in" in the [igloohome app quick start guide](https://support.igloohome.co/support/solutions/articles/35000183120-igloohome-app-quick-start-guide).
2. In the igloohome mobile app, add your igloohome devices.\
   For more information, see "Pair your lock" in the [igloohome app quick start guide](https://support.igloohome.co/support/solutions/articles/35000183120-igloohome-app-quick-start-guide).
3. To be able to configure your igloohome smart locks remotely, trigger lock and unlock actions, and use custom codes, install the [igloohome Wi-Fi Bridge](https://www.igloohome.co/en-US/products/bridge), and then pair your locks to the bridge.
4. Note your login credentials for the igloohome mobile app, and use these credentials to log in to the [Seam Connect Webview](../core-concepts/connect-webviews/) to add your devices to Seam.
