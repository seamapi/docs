# TTLock Locks

## Overview

TTLock produces both hardware and software for smart locks. Many other manufacturers utilize TTLock's platform to create their own smart lock products. Locks built on this platform are compatible with a wide range of entrance types, including traditional doors, glass doors, locker doors, and key cylinders. With the TTLock mobile app, businesses can effortlessly lock and unlock doors and program key codes into the locks.

## Setup Instructions

To control TTLock devices using Seam, you must prompt owners of these devices to perform the following steps:

    Your users must be the top administrator for each TTLock that they want to connect to Seam.

## Troubleshooting

### Lock Not Appearing in Seam

Your users must be the top administrator for each TTLock that they want to connect to Seam. That is, they must supply the credentials for the top administrator account when completing the [Connect Webview](../core-concepts/connect-webviews/) to connect their TTLocks to Seam.&#x20;

### Lock Not Paired to Gateway Error

On the device, if you notice a `ttlock_lock_not_paired_to_gateway` error, you will need to purchase [a compatible gateway](https://ttlock.eu/shop/tag/ttlock+gateway/) and pair it to the lock. Follow the [set up instructions](ttlock-locks.md#set-up-instructions) to configure the door lock.

### Gateway Unlocking Not Enabled Warning

On the device, if you notice a `ttlock_lock_gateway_unlocking_not_enabled` warning, you will need to follow the [set up instructions](ttlock-locks.md#set-up-instructions) to turn on the "Remote Unlock" feature.

### Power-Saving Mode

Certain TTLock Wi-Fi lock models have a power-saving mode. When these locks are in power-saving mode, the Seam API cannot control them remotely. If a TTLock Wi-Fi lock is not completing requested actions successfully, confirm whether the lock is in power-saving mode. If so, prompt your user to turn off power-saving mode, and then retry the operation.
