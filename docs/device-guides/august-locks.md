# August Locks

## Overview

August produces smart locks for the residential market. Seam integrates directly with the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, as well as with additional August Smart Locks through the August ConnectÂ® Wi-Fi Bridge. In addition, Seam supports the August Smart Keypad accessory.

Each August lock attaches to an existing deadbolt, replacing only the lock component on the inside of a door. Consequently, August locks do not change the exterior of locks, and the existing physical keys still work with installed August locks.&#x20;

***

## Supported Devices

This integration supports all August Smart Lock models that are connected to Wi-Fi, either through built-in Wi-Fi or using the [August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge](https://august.com/products/august-connect). Seam also supports the addition of the optional [August Smart Keypad](https://august.com/products/august-smart-keypad) to enable entering access codes to control the lock.
