  overview: |
    Access control systems centralize access authorization for buildings, which means that you can use a single system to grant users access to one or more entrances. An access control system manages the following elements:

    - Who has access
    - The entrances to which users have access
    - The access schedule for each user and entrance
    - The access mechanism—PIN codes, mobile keys, or plastic cards—for each access grant

    To grant access using the Seam access control system API, use the following basic process:

    1. Create `acs_user`s.
    2. Configure access for these users.
       For some access control systems, configure the allowed entrances and access schedule. For other systems, use `acs_access_group`s. For details, see the [system integration guide](https://docs.seam.co/latest/device-and-system-integration-guides/overview#access-control-systems) for your access control system.
    3. Create `acs_credential`s, which are the digital means of granting access to users, such as PIN codes, mobile keys, and plastic (RFID) cards.
       If you are developing a mobile app to provide access for your users, you can also use [Seam's iOS and Android SDKs](https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/mobile-access/mobile-device-sdks) that pair with the Seam API to create and manage mobile keys.
